!!! THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL !!!

## Purpose

The WordPress Support Tracker Chrome Extension is designed to help users monitor new responses on WordPress.org support topics they have created or replied to. The extension displays the number of new responses directly on the browser icon, providing a convenient way to stay updated without manually checking the forums.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Login Fails**:
  - Ensure that you are entering the correct WordPress.org username and password.
  - Verify that your network connection is stable.
  - Check if there are any updates to the extension or WordPress.org API changes that might affect functionality.

- **Badge Count Not Updating**:
  - Check the console for errors by right-clicking the extension icon, selecting "Inspect Popup", and then "Console".
  - Ensure that you are logged in correctly and that your session has not expired.
  - Verify that the WordPress.org support forum structure has not changed, as this could affect the parsing logic.

### How to Report Issues

- If you encounter any issues not covered here, please report them by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Pitfalls to Watch Out For

- **Security**:
  - Ensure that your login credentials are stored securely. The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store credentials, but consider additional encryption if needed.
  - Be cautious of phishing attempts or entering credentials on unsecured networks.

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Be aware of potential rate limiting by WordPress.org when making frequent requests. Adjust the check interval if necessary to avoid being blocked.

- **API Changes**:
  - The extension relies on the structure of WordPress.org's support forum pages. If these structures change, the extension may break. Regular maintenance and updates are recommended.
